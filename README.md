# Parallax's Robotics Curriculum

The goal of this repository is to provide a collection of articles containing information helpful to building VEX robots. Since its founding in 2015, our robotics program has learned a ton of stuff, and to ensure that future students receive that information, we've made it all publicly available here. There are a huge variety of topics and guides to troubleshoot certain issues within this repository.
