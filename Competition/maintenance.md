# Competition Maintenance
During competitions, you have to do quick tune-ups on your robot before and after rounds or practices to make sure that the robot is always operating at 100% efficiency.
 
## What to do before the robot is used

* Screws need to be tightened if they are loose
* Put on fresh rubber bands
* Batteries need to be replaced with fresh ones
* Pneumatics need to be pumped up
* Make sure the firmware is not corrupted, and the latest code is flashed on the robot
* Put on the right license plates
* Make sure the robot wasnâ€™t sabotaged by other teams (partially kidding here)
 
## What to do after the robot is used 

* Screws need to be tightened if they are loose
* Rubber bands need to be taken off after rounds and switched (if any have broken or look frayed)
* Make sure no nuts or other small parts have fallen off
* Give the motors time to cool down if they are hot
* Check for broken or bent parts
* Check for chipped gears
* Tighten wiggling motors
