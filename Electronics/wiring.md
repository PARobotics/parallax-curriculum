# Wiring

Good wiring is **crucial** to creating a robot that looks and performs like a top-tier robot. If wires are loose and not neatly cinched up next to support structures, it’s very possible they could come loose (meaning motors and sensors won’t work), and can get caught and pulled out when your robot moves. 
 
## What is good wiring? 

Here are some tips to ensure your wiring is good: 
* Connections to cortex and power expander always have their clip on, so nothing falls out. 
* Connections between wires (i.e. motor to motor controller, motor to extension wire) are ziptied, and then taped so they do not come undone. 
* When wires are wrapped around moving joints, make sure they are not too tight, and do not get caught in these joints
* Wires are cinched neatly to support beams using zipties so they are not dangling. Wires should not be hanging across the robot: They must be wrapped around supports. 
* The extra part of the zipties should be cut off
* When connecting wires (i.e motor to motor controller), make sure the prongs have the same direction (red wire lines up with red wire and blue lines up with blue). Switching direction of prong switches direction of motor, and you want to be sure you know what the direction is.
