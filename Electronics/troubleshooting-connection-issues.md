# Connection Issues? 

Is the connection between the VEX cortex and the joystick finnicky? Does it frequently disconnect for brief periods of time? If so, try the following: 

* Make sure the cortex is not surrounded by wires on top. These wires will create a Faraday cage when powered, meaning communication will likely be blocked or weakened by them. 
* Make sure the cortex has "breathing space".
