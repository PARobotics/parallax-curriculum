# Device Drivers

Device drivers are necessary for your computer to communicate and flash code to your robot. To install device drivers, download the newest VEXNet Serial USB Driver from [here](https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexedr/resources/firmware). Unzip the downloaded file, and open the installer.exe file (corresponding to whether you have a 32bit or 64bit machine). Follow the instructions in the installer window.

To confirm if you have installed the drivers properly, go to the Windows Device Manager, click on "Ports", and check that there is a "Vex Robotics Comm Port there." If you ever run into issues with drivers, simply uninstall them here, and reinstall them.
