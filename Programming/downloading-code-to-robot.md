# Downloading Code to the Robot

## Over a Wire

Use a Usb-A to Usb-A wire to connect the robot to a USB port within your computer. In robotC, click the "Download" button. 

## Wirelessly

First, install the correct device drivers. You can learn how to do that [here](https://github.com/PARobotics/parallax-curriculum/blob/master/Programming/device-drivers.md). Next, pair the joystick to the cortex (see how to do that [here](https://github.com/PARobotics/parallax-curriculum/blob/master/Programming/pairing-the-joystick.md)). Connect the programming hardware kit's USB port to your computer's port, and connect the other end to the port on the joystick labeled "PROGRAM". Press "Download" in robotC.
