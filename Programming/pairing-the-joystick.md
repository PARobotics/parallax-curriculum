# Pairing the Joystick

Follow this process to wirelessly connect the joystick and cortex. This process only needs to be done once. 

1) Turn off both the joystick and cortex, and unplug the VEXNet Keys. Connect the joystick and cortex with a USB-A cable. Turn on the cortex and wait for the lights on the cortex to go all green. Turn everything off, and reattach the VEXNet keys. The cortex and joystick should be paired.
